Consider a system of 3 linear eq.
$$
\begin{cases}
a_{11}x+a_{12}y+a_{13}z=b_{1} \\
a_{21}x+a_{22}y+a_{23}z=b_{2} \\
a_{31}x+a_{32}y+a_{33}z=b_{3}
\end{cases}
$$
where $a_{ij}$, $b_{i}$, ($i, j$ = 1, 2, 3) are scalars in $\mathbb{R}$

Each eqn defines a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$
There are 3 possible situations:

#### Linear Dependence vs Linear Independence
Two vectors are linearly dependent if they are parallel to each other
If the two vectors are not parallel, they are linearly independent
