Hi D-5, 

Overall, pretty good job on the poster. 

To start off, the visuals were descriptive, and generally easy to understand. However, there are two things that could be improved. If the concept sketches had descriptions for their functions, it would make it a little easier for the reader to understand what's going on. Additionally, on the risk assessment slide, there is a large screenshot of a worksheet that I feel is too much text on the screen, and could have been shortened using a simpler chart.

Moving on to the isometric drawings, they were high quality and very detailed. I didn't really see any need any improvement for this, so great job!

For the risk register, there were some different risk types and sources that were considered, which was great. However, there weren't too many different risks, and you could improve by adding more risks to the risk register. 

As for the experiments, the first experiment was good, and helped support the design decisions. However, you needed to have two experiments to fulfill the requirement, and you guys only had one.

Overall, the biggest change that you guys could make would be to add another experiment to explain your design.

Other than that, the engineering drawings were very good, the rest of the presentation was very detailed. 
Good job guys!
