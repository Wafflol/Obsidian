For an $n\times n$ transformation matrix $A$, a vector $\vec{v}$ and a scalar $\lambda$ are called an eigen-pair of $A$ for:
$$\vec{v} \neq 0$$
$$A\vec{v}=\lambda \vec{v}$$
$\vec{v}$ is the eigenvector, and $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue

Eigenvectors are never 0, but eigenvalues can be

For an $n\times n$ matrix, often there exist $n$ eigen-pairs, especially when no repeated eigenvalues occur
