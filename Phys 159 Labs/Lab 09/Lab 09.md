- Objective: We are trying to measure the pressure in the room and measure the molar density of air
- We know that the pressure in the room is equivalent to 1 atm, and it is caused by the pressure of the gas molecules in the air. It is related by the volume of a space, as well as the number of molecules and the temperature
- The pressure of a gas is how much pressure that the weight of air exerts of the earth
- Molar density is the related to the number of molecules per volume of space
- thus, the units for molar density is mol/volume


5. **Procedure**
Tools used: Lever, fulcrum, support, pin, scale, calilper, syringe, weights
- First, set up the apparatus like shown in the picture: (make sure to plug up the syringe)
- ![[Pasted image 20240320190951.png|400]] 
- Then, use three weights to find the calibration factor:
	- attach the weights one by one onto the syringe
	- measure the reading from the scale each time
	- also record the masses of each weight
	- then divide the mass of the weights by the reading when they were on the syringe to get a ratio of the masses, and take their average
- attach an assortment of masses to the syringe and measure the volume of the syringe for each mass
- convert the mass to force, and then graph it against 1/volume in matlab
- use matlab to find the slope and y-intercept
- use the equations above to find the values and the uncertainties
