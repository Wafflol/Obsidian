1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: We are trying to find the capacitance of a capacitor
	- The capacitance of a capacitor is related how much 
1. **Explore Tools**

| Tool          | Physical Parameter | Resolution | Reading Uncertainty | Range      | Usage                               |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Osciilloscope | Voltage            | 200mV      | 100mV               | -150V-150V | To measure the voltage in a circuit |

3. **Relate Quantities**
	- Things we can measure
		- *replace with measurements ex. length of string*
	We can measure *replace with measurable dimension*
	*State all variables and what they mean*
	*derive equation*
	*derive uncertainties*
4. **Test & Try**
	One possible procedure:

	Another possible procedure:

	The two procedures differ in that
