   Battery Cells The battery pack bears the Nanoavionics credibility as one of the leading companies in the nano-satellite mission design field (ISO 9001 certified). Flight-heritage data from previous successful missions using the same EPS Board [7, Sect. 2.7] are to be found in the NanoSats Database. According to [8], the battery pack's design provide over-voltage and over-current protection measures. As a result the function of the battery cells will remain at the desirable level avoiding any potential mission threatening event [7, Sec. 2.6]. The thermal analysis concluded to the maximum and minimum temperature values for 18 Space Debris Mitigation Report [SDMR] ASAT_SDMR_2021-05-31_v2.2 the baseline orbit (LTAN 6) in which the EPS board will be exposed to [4, Sec 2.2]. These values are cited in Table VI. Table VI: EPS’s Board Maximum & Minimum Exposed Temperature Scenarios Values Hottest Case 20.84 ◦C Coldest Case -8.816 ◦C Based on Table V it is confirmed that the exposed temperature for the battery cells is within the acceptable limits. Furthermore, an on-board heater is integrated allowing the user to select the desirable temperature levels for the batteries [7, Sect. 2.3] while guaranteeing that these will remain between the acceptable limits. Another potential danger for the battery cells to malfunction is the exposure to radiation. The radiation analysis concluded that as far the baseline orbit is concerned the TID equals to 3.9 krad during the entirety of the mission [11]. The Nanoavionics EPS board is tested to NASA GEVS environmental levels and up to 20 kRad TID [8]. Furthermore, a set of radiation protection methods are implemented [7, Sec. 2.6]. The manufacturer of the battery cells, Nanoavionics, has informed us that they conduct a range of in-house certification tests to assess the quality of every cell. These acceptance tests include: Vacuum testing, full charge discharge cycle testing for capacity measurement, and impedance measurements. Also, qualification campaigns are performed on the battery packs, for TVAC and vibration (up to 14 Grms, according to the NASA GEVS 7000 standard). However, more details on the tests will become available to the team after the purchase of the batteries. The presence or absence of further lot qualification procedures is currently not known and will be included as soon as it becomes available. Lastly, Nanoavionics does not provide an ISS certification or qualification as we have already discarded the ISS orbit scenari
