$$x^2-x-2<0$$
$$(x-2)(x+1)<0$$
$$\text{3 possible situations, x-2 is positive  and x+1 is positive, x-2 is negative and x+1 is positive, and both are negative}$$
to make a negative, you need a negative and positive
thus we have to choose when $\text{x-2 is negative and x+1 is positive}$
$x-2$ is negative when $x < 2$, and $x+1$ is positive when $x>-1$
thus, to make $(x-2)(x+1)$ negative, we need x to be between those numbers

$$x+y<0$$
for two integers to sum to a negative, at least one number has to be negative.
___
let $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$
assume $x < y$, and $y^2< x^2$\
for $x^2 > y^2$, sqrt both sides so $\mid x \mid> \mid y\mid$
if both x and y are positive numbers, $\mid y\mid < \mid x\mid$ simplifies to $y<x$, which contradicts $x<y$
so x and y cannot both be positive, and at least one has to be negative. 
If $x$ is positive, it would contradict $\mid x\mid>\mid y\mid$, as $x<y$. Thus, we know $x$ has to be negative.
Consider two cases for $y$
Case 1:
if $y\geq 0$
since $\mid x\mid>\mid y\mid$ and $x<0$, $-x>y$
$x+y<0$.

Case 2:
$y<0$
the sum of two negative numbers is always negative. 
Thus, in this case, $x+y<0$
Therefore, as seen in these two cases, no matter the sign of $y$, $x+y<0$. Thus, the implication is true.
