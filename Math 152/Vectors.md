1. Represented by lower case letter: $\vec{v}$ to differentiate from [[Scalar]] $v$
	Also sometimes represented by bold **v**
2. Each scalar in a vector is called a *component*
3. Number of components in a vector = dimension of the vector
4. Order/position of each component in vectors must be consistent

##### Magnitude & Direction
Magnitude is defined by the length of the line drawn from the origin to the point
Direction is defined by the arrow
Magnitude is represented by double vertical bars 
$$
\mid\mid\vec{a}\mid\mid = \sqrt{ 1^2 + 1^2 } = \sqrt{ 2 }
$$
#### Vector addition and scalar multiplication
Let $\vec{a}$ = $(a_{1}, a_{2})$ ,  $\vec{b}$ = $(b_{1}, b_{2})$ be vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and c, d be scalars. Then,
1. $\vec{a} \pm \vec{b} = (a_{1}\pm  b_{1}, a_{2} \pm b_{2}$)
2. $\vec{c}a = (ca_{1}, ca_{2})$
3. $-\vec{a} = (-a_{1}, -a_{2})$
4. $\vec{a}-\vec{a} = 0$
#### Properties of addition/scalar multiplication
1. $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \vec{b} + \vec{a}$
2. $\vec{a} = (\vec{b} + \vec{c})$ = ($\vec{a} + \vec{b}) + \vec{c}$
3. $\vec{a} + 0 = \vec{a}$
4. distributive with [[Scalar]]
