1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: We are trying to map the pressure distribution of sound waves inside a tube for $f_{0}$. We are also trying to determine the speed of sound
	- We know harmonic sound wave, we can find anti-nodes and nodes by mapping out the pressure and seeing where the pressure has maximum amplitude and minimum amplitude to find out the wavelength of the sound wave
	- The wavelength of a sound wave is the distance between peaks of the wave for a snapshot in time (note: the wavelength is related to the speed of sound)
	- The speed of sound is also related to frequency, which we would find by using a time vs pressure graph of the sound wave
2. **Explore Tools**

| Tool | Physical Parameter | Resolution | Reading Uncertainty | Range | Usage |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Osciilloscope | Voltage |  |  | -150V-150V | To measure the voltage in a circuit |
| Ruler | Length | 1mm | $\pm 0.5mm$ | 0cm-100cm | To measure length for a long object |

We also used a microphone, speaker box, and waveform generator

Note: we used a waveform generator, but it is not in the table for obvious reasons

Shown below is a picture of the setup. + tools used. To replicate, connect the waveform generator, oscilloscope, and speaker box to power. Then, a splitter at ch1 of the waveform generator is connected to the oscilloscope at ch2  and "sine in" at the speaker box. And then,
we connect ch1 of the oscilloscope to the speaker box at "scope", and the microphone into the speaker box.

Below is a drawing of the contraption:

Note: to make sure our speaker is working, we will have our generator at just a high enough amplitude so that we can hear it faintly

Experimenting with the setup:
While testing the microphone and the speaker without the tube, we noticed that the amplitude of the microphone signal decreased as some function of distance
As we increased the frequency on the waveform generator, the distance between the peaks on the oscilloscope decreased, while the opposite happened when we decreased the frequency

While testing the microphone and speaker with the tube:
As we slid the microphone to the right, the amplitude on the oscilloscope would change from very big to very small. We think this is because we are finding the pressure anti-nodes and nodes that are created by the sound waves

After testing from 300-400hz with the generator, we found that the highest peak in the middle of the tube was found at 323.2 Hz

Note: we used the meter stick to place the mic in approximately the centre of the tube

3. **Relate Quantities**
	- Things we can measure
		- *replace with measurements ex. length of string*
	We can measure *replace with measurable dimension*
	*State all variables and what they mean*
	*derive equation*
	*derive uncertainties*
