Hi T-1, 
Overall, well done on the e-poster. Going through the rubric, with the visuals first, I thought you guys had professional and impactful visuals. They were easy to understand, and helped convey the design process more clearly. 
However, on the key risk identification slide, I felt like there wasn't a need to add the generic risk matrix table, as it clogged up the slide, and makes the other components of the slide a little harder to see. Other than that, the visuals were ok.

For the risk assessment and management, many different risks were considered, and the management decisions for the risks are clearly stated and well supported by the slides.

For the isometric drawings, although they look well put together. However, they are not supposed to show hidden lines, and thus don't completely follow the guidelines.

As for the experiments, they were sufficient and strongly supported the design decisions made on the claw.

Great job on the poster guys!
