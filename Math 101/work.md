We can first write out $\bar{g}(t)$, which is:
$$(\frac{1}{\omega r})(\sin(\omega t)-\sin(\omega t-\omega r))$$
Then, as $\sin(x) = \sin(x+k*2\pi)$ where $k \in \mathbb{R}$, if $\sin(\omega t) - \sin(\omega t - \omega r) =0$ (which means that there will be no ripples as $\bar{g}(t)$ = 0), then we can simply solve for when $\omega r$ is equal to multiples of $2\pi$
Thus,
$$
\omega r = 2\pi k \text{ where } k \in \mathbb{R} \neq 0
$$
