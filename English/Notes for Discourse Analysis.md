#### Introduction
- State of knowledge
	- secured generalization
		- generalizations made with a citation
	- citation and reporting: WHO + HOW(WHY) + WHAT
		- Direct speech (quotations); indirect speech (paraphrase)
		- Reporting expressions (active and passive) and parenthetical citations
			- active = lastname (year) + "says"
			- passive = passive reporting expression + author/parenthetical
		- double reporting
	- Apposition
		- defining the latter term through an apposition--a double structure which puts two equivalent definitions side-by-side--signalled by the word "including," a colon, and a list of example mental health conditions
	- Emphasis
		- Cleft sentences beginning with *it*
			- it was X that
			- "it was julie who brought the cookies"
		- End-weight principle beginning with *anticipatory-it*
			- "it is generally accepted that X"
			- "it may be argued that X"
- Knowledge Deficit
	- Self-reference and the discursive I/we
		- discursive we introduces own original argument
	- Modal expressions
		- indicate likelihood from very unlikely to very likely
			- may/might, can/could, would, should, will, must
	- Forecast
		- utilizes the discursive we to create a forecast
			- such as "we begin, we draw, we then offer, we note, we conclude"
		- outlines in advance how the article's main sections will proceed
			- shows how the main sections *(list sections)* will be organized

#### Conclusion
- Qualifying expressions - expresses limitations
	- The knowledge making I/we
		- less assertive than speaker who self-references, forecasts, and emphasizes (discursive I/we)
		- indicates the researcher reasoning from a position of partial knowledge (e.g., "i think," "we believe," etc.)
	- Modal expressions
		- indicate lack of certainty or signal strong but not infallible conviction
		- challenge established positions and suggest new/alternative perspectives
