Starting by rewriting $F(s)$ as a series of simple integrals, as we can see from the graph, the graph oscillates between the values 0 and 1 every integer. Thus, as we know that $F(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \, dt$, we can rewrite $F(s)$ as a series of integrals that alternates between 0 and 

$$F(s) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{2}(-1)^n$$
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) * (1-1^n)$$
