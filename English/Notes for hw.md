summarize as 3 mini summaries

tree maps wont connect up

use reporting expressions to talk about different trees

steffen reports on different sources
- doesnt come up with ideas himself
- borrows ideas from other sources
- uses citations and reporting expressions
- look at **reporting expressions**
	- as you talk through branches, if you come across reporting expression, talk about it in summary and his attitude
In zalasiewicz
- mostly cites ppl parenthetically
- when talking abt great acceleration, he uses a reporting expression
	- one reason = to put emphasis on this idea
	- indicates emphasis and preference on this hypothesis over the other ones, where he does not

hw is both summary + analysis
- analysis on steffen's opinion
- practice double reporting
- (Wagner cited in Lu, 1992)
