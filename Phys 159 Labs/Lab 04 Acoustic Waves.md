1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: We are trying to map the pressure distribution of sound waves inside a tube for $f_{0}$. We are also trying to determine the speed of sound
	- We know harmonic sound wave, we can find anti-nodes and nodes by mapping out the pressure and seeing where the pressure has maximum amplitude and minimum amplitude to find out the wavelength of the sound wave
	- The wavelength of a sound wave is the distance between peaks of the wave for a snapshot in time (note: the wavelength is related to the speed of sound)
	- The speed of sound is also related to frequency, which we would find by using a time vs pressure graph of the sound wave
2. **Explore Tools**

| Tool | Physical Parameter | Resolution | Reading Uncertainty | Range | Usage |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Osciilloscope | Voltage |  |  | -150V-150V | To measure the voltage in a circuit |
We also used a microphone, speaker box, and waveform generator

Note: we used a waveform generator, but it is not in the table for obvious reasons

Shown below is a picture of the setup. + tools used. To replicate, connect the waveform generator, oscilloscope, and speaker box to power. Then, ch1 of the waveform generator to the speaker at "sine in", ch1 of the oscilloscope to the speaker box at "scope", and the audio jack from the mic to the speaker box.

3. **Relate Quantities**
	- Things we can measure
		- *replace with measurements ex. length of string*
	We can measure *replace with measurable dimension*
	*State all variables and what they mean*
	*derive equation*
	*derive uncertainties*
4. **Test & Try**
	One possible procedure:

	Another possible procedure:

	The two procedures differ in that
