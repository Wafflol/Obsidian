#### Controlling Variables
Need an equation to solve for each controlling variable

#### Evil Currents
Every evil branch has an unknown current, $i_{e}$
$EVL := V_{+}=V_{-}+V_{S}$

### [[Solving any circuit]]: MNA
Choose a reference node
Label every true node (KCL)*
Choose R and RV current directions
Identify, draw and label every evil current (EVL)
Locate and count every controlling variable (CTL)

\*not for reference node
