1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: We are trying to measure the pressure in the room and measure the molar density of air
	- We know that the pressure in the room is equivalent to 1 atm, and it is caused by the pressure of the gas molecules in the air. It is related by the volume of a space, as well as the number of molecules and the temperature
	- The pressure of a gas is how much pressure that the weight of air exerts of the earth
	- Molar density is the related to the number of molecules per volume of space
	- thus, the units for molar density is mol/volume
