1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: We are trying to find the capacitance of a capacitor
	- The capacitance of a capacitor is related how much charge a capacitor can hold
	- The amount of charge a capacitor is also related to the voltage of the power supply

3. **Relate Quantities**
	- Things we can measure
		- *replace with measurements ex. length of string*
	We can measure *replace with measurable dimension*
	*State all variables and what they mean*
	*derive equation*
	*derive uncertainties*
4. **Test & Try**
	One possible procedure:

	Another possible procedure:

	The two procedures differ in that
