We first start with the formula for $\bar{C}_{101}$:
$$
\bar{C}_{101}(t) = at^2+(b-a)t+\left( \frac{a}{3}-\frac{b}{2}+C \right)
$$
Then, we can plug in the numbers we got from part b:
$$
430 = 0.012997t^2-50.125t+48630
$$
Solving for t using the quadratic equation, we get:
$$
0 = 0.012997t^2-50.125t+48200
$$
$$
t = 2027.8
$$
Thus, $\bar{C}_{101}(t)$ will equal 430ppm in the year 2027
