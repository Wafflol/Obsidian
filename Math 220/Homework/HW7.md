To begin, the power set $\mathcal{P}(\{ 1, 2 \})$ is: 
$$\{ \emptyset, \{ 1 \}, \{ 2 \}, \{ 1, 2 \} \}$$
Thus, using the definition of the relation $\mathcal{R}$, the elements in $\mathcal{R}$ are: 
$$\mathcal{R} = \{ (\emptyset, \emptyset), (\emptyset, \{ 1 \}), (\{ 1 \}, \emptyset), (\emptyset, \{ 2 \}), (\{ 2 \}, \emptyset) , (\emptyset, \{ 1, 2 \}), (\{ 1, 2 \}, \emptyset) , (\{ 1 \}, \{ 2 \}), (\{ 2 \}, \{ 1 \})\}$$

2.1
Let $R$ be reflexive. Then, as the definition of reflexivity states that a relation $R$ is reflexive when $\forall b \in B, a R a$, it follows that $\forall a \in A$, if $R$ is reflexive, then $(a, a) \in R$, and thus, as $\bar{R} = (A \times A) - R$, then it follows that $(a, a) \not\in \bar{R}$ .
Thus, it follows that $\bar{R}$ is not reflexive, and the implication is false.

2.2
Let $R$ be symmetric. Then, as the definition of symmetry states that a relation $\mathcal{R}$ is symmetric when $\forall a, b,  a R b \Rightarrow b Ra$, it follows that $\forall a,b \in A$, if $R$ is symmetric, then $(a, b), (b, a) \in R$, and thus, as $\bar{R} = (A \times A) - R$, then it follows that $(a, b), (b, a) \not\in \bar{R}$ .
Thus, it follows that $\bar{R}$ is not symmetric, and the implication is false.

2.3
Let $R$ be transitive. Then, as the definition of transitivity states that a relation $R$ is transitive when $\forall a, b, c, (a Rb) \land (bRc) \Rightarrow a Rc$, so because $(a, b), (b,c) \in R$, and $\bar{R} = (A \times A) - R$, then it follows that $(a, b), (b, c) \not\in R$. Thus, it follows that the implication is false.
