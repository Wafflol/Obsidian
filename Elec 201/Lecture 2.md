### Lecture 1 review
$$q(C)$$
$$i\left( \frac{C}{s} = A\right)$$
$$v\left( \frac{J}{C} = V \right) \to \text{drop}$$
$$V_{AB}=V_{A}-V_{B}$$
Absorbed power:
$$p=(v_{o}-v_{d})i$$

### Lec 2

Bernard Tellegen's Theorem:
Total power in a circuit = zero:
$$\sum P_{\text{abs}} = \sum P_{\text{del}} $$

[[KVL]] - Kirchoff's Voltage Law
[[KCL]] - Kirchoff's Current Law

Resistance = opposition to current
$$V =Ri$$
Inductance = opposition to change in current
$$V = L \frac{di}{dt}$$
Capacitance = opposition to change in voltage
$$i = C \frac{dV}{dt}$$

#### Four ideal circuit elements
##### Ideal resistor
power is always positive
absorbs power
$$V=IR$$
$$\begin{align}
p &=vi \\
p&=Ri^2  \\
p &= \frac{v^2}{R}
\end{align}$$

##### The ideal voltage source
Drop does not depend on its current, nor what is connected to it
