1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: *we are trying to find x*
	- *insert explanation of what x is related to and what it means*
2. **Explore Tools**

| Tool | Physical Parameter | Resolution | Reading Uncertainty | Range | Usage |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Osciilloscope | Voltage | 200mV | 100mV | -150V-150V | To measure the voltage in a circuit |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

*add pictures of tools used*

3. **Relate Quantities**
	- Things we can measure
		- *replace with measurements ex. length of string*
	We can measure *replace with measurable dimension*
	*State all variables and what they mean*
	*derive equation*
	*derive uncertainties*
4. **Test & Try**
	One possible procedure:

	Another possible procedure:

	The two procedures differ in that


5. **Procedure**
Tools used:
- procedure
Add pictures of procedure
