1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: We are trying to find the capacitance of a capacitor,
	- The capacitance of a capacitor is related how much charge a capacitor can hold
	- The amount of charge a capacitor is also related to the voltage of the power supply

|               |                                        |            |                     |            |                                                                                  |
We measured the capacitance of the capacitor with the DMM to get an expected value for later: 101.6 $\pm 0.05$ nF
Using the DMM, we can measure the resistances of the two resistors: 1986$\pm 1\Omega$, and $5055 \pm 1 \Omega$

We also used a breadboard, a PCB, 2 resistors, a capacitor, and the waveform generator.

3. **Relate Quantities**
	- We can measure voltage drops using a DMM 
		- *replace with measurements ex. length of string*
	We know that $q = CV$ where $q$ is charge on a capacitor, and $C$ and $V$ are the capacitance and voltage of the circuit respectively
	Thus, if we know the charge and voltage, we can find capacitance.
	We know that $q(t)$ for a 
	*derive equation*
	*derive uncertainties*
