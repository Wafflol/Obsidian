$$3 \nmid n^2+5n+5$$
$$\begin{align}
n^2+5n+5\neq 3 \\

$$x^2-x-2<0$$
$$(x-2)(x+1)<0$$
$$\text{3 possible situations, x-2 is positive  and x+1 is positive, x-2 is negative and x+1 is positive, and both are negative}$$
to make a negative, you need a negative and positive
thus we have to choose when $\text{x-2 is negative and x+1 is positive}$
$x-2$ is negative when $x < 2$, and $x+1$ is positive when $x>-1$
thus, to make $(x-2)(x+1)$ negative, we need x to be between those numbers
