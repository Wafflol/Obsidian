1. **Clarify objective**
	- Objective: We are trying to measure the pressure in the room and measure the molar density of air
	- We know that the pressure in the room is equivalent to 1 atm, and it is caused by the pressure of the gas molecules in the air. It is related by the volume of a space, as well as the number of molecules and the temperature
	- The pressure of a gas is how much pressure that the weight of air exerts of the earth
	- Molar density is the related to the number of molecules per volume of space
	- thus, the units for molar density is mol/volume

| Plunger/syringe | Volume             | 0.2 mL     | 0.1 mL              | 0-10mL  | To measure the volume of fluid in the syringe |
| Caliper         | Length             | 0.05mm     | 0.025mm             | 0-155mm | To measure the length of objects              |
| Scale           | Mass               | 1g         | 0.5g                | 0kg-5Kg | To measure the mass of objects                |
We also have lever and fulcrum, as well as a pin that goes through the lever

3. **Relate Quantities**
	- Things we can measure
		- *replace with measurements ex. length of string*
	We can measure *replace with measurable dimension*
	*State all variables and what they mean*
	*derive equation*
	*derive uncertainties*
4. **Test & Try**
	One possible procedure:

	Another possible procedure:

	The two procedures differ in that
