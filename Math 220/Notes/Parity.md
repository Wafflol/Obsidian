Definition: 
	an integer $m$ is **even** if we have $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$
	an integer $m$ is odd if we have $m = 2j+1$ for some integer j
Definition:
	Given integers $k$ and $n$ we say that k divides n ($k | n$)if there exists an integer $h$ such that $n = hk$
	Similarly, we say that k does not divide n if there is no integer $h$ such that $n = hk$
