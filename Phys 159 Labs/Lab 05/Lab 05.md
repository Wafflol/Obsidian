**Procedure**
Note: for the uncertainties for our oscilloscope measurements, we used 1/4 of the variation in the peaks.
We are doing procedure #2
1. First, connect the waveform generator, oscilloscope, and speaker box to power. Then, a splitter at ch1 of the waveform generator is connected to the oscilloscope at ch2  and "sine in" at the speaker box. And then, connect ch1 of the oscilloscope to the speaker box at "scope", and the microphone into the speaker box.
2. put the tube right up to the speaker, and set up the microphone in the center of the tube
3. Then, find the first fundamental frequency by playing around at around 300-400 hz on the waveform generator, until you find the peak on the oscilloscope.
4. Record this data point for frequency and record the harmonic
5. repeat for 3rd 5th, and extra harmonics if necessary
6. Then, graph it on matlab, find the slope, and use the equations above to find the speed of sound

Tools used:
- oscilloscope
- meter stick
- tube
- speaker
- waveform generator
