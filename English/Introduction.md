The purpose of this report is to illustrate that CNTs could be used
effectively for treating cancer. It is primarily based on library and
internet research. The opinions of Dr. Honjie Dai, an Associate
Professor of Chemistry at Stanford and a CNT expert were also
taken into account while writing this report.
Advances in nanotechnology have enabled researchers to create
carbon particles, called Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are small
enough to fit into individual human cells. Carbon nanotubes
exhibit many interesting properties, some of which make them
viable candidates for use in cancer treatment. Current cancer
treatment methods are not very effective and have many side
effects. Cancer patients would suffer from much less side effects
and would have a higher chance of survival if CNTs could be used
to selectively kill cancer cells.
The first part of the report provides a brief explanation of current
cancer treatment methods. Background information on CNTs, and
an explanation of their synthesis and general properties are also
provided. Then details pertaining to how CNTs could be used to
treat cancer are discussed and followed by an assessment of the
possible advantages and disadvantages of using CNTs in place of
standard cancer treatments.
